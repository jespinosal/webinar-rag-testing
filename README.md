### TEST RAG SYSTEM
We will cover the following topics: an introduction to RAG systems, evaluation metrics, and synthetic data generation to automate tests. We will also cover theory and Python code implementation.
The goal is to share insights of automatic testing for testers.
We are going to use OpenAI model to Generate text, and Tabily app to ground RAG system with internet information, and RAG for evaluation and synthetic data generation.


### INSTRUCTIONS 
1. Request OpenAI credentioals in dial portal
2. Request Tabily credentials in Tabily portal
3. Create python enviroment (optional) and install credentials
    3.1 Create venv >> python -m venv .my_venv
    3.1 Activate venv>> source .\.my_venv\Scripts\activate
    3.3 Install libraries on the env >> 
4. Connect to EPAM VPN
5. rename file ".env_example" to ".env" and copy/paste your Tabily and OpenAI credentials
6. Run notebook lab_tag.ipynb
7. The secton 6/7 is a challenge to perform automatic test on the synthetic generated data
